Licensing and Project Vision

Originally, Converge included a partial licensing system because we planned to offer paid addons. However, after careful consideration, we decided to make Converge a fully open-source framework with all its addons included â€” now and forever.

This means Converge and its entire ecosystem will always be 100% free for everyone to use, modify, and contribute to. Our goal is to foster a thriving open-source community by providing powerful, free tools without restrictions.

Thank you for supporting the project and being part of this journey!
